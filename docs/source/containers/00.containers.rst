Containers
==========

Containers hold biospecimens. A biospecimen can be found only in one container.


List Containers
---------------

- Use the GET /containers/ endpoint to view the list of containers

The following curl request can be used on the command line to list the containers available.

.. code-block:: bash
    curl -X 'GET' \
    'https://vbr-api.a2cps.cloud/containers/?offset=0&limit=50' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer Token'

A successful response would look like:


Update Container Location
-------------------------

- Use the PATCH /containers/{container_id}/location to update the location of a container.
- Enter the *container_id* field and modify the request body with the correct *location_id* and *comment*.


A successful response would look like:

.. code-block:: bash

   {
        "container_id": "string",
        "container_tracking_id": "string",
        "container_type": "string",
        "location": "string",
        "status": "string",
        "tracking_id": "string"
   }
